If still issues:- Check that `out/_redirects` exists after build- Verify publish directory is set to `out`### Build timeout**Issue**: Build takes too long**Solution**: The build should complete in 15-20 seconds. If timing out:- Check for infinite loops in build process- Verify no large dependencies being installed---## 📈 Performance TipsYour site is already optimized, but for best results:1. **Enable Netlify Analytics** (optional, paid):   - Site settings → Analytics → Enable2. **Add Build Plugins** (optional):   - Lighthouse plugin for performance monitoring   - Image optimization plugin (though we already use SVG)3. **Set up Form Notifications** (if you add contact form later):   - Netlify Forms are free and easy to integrate---## 🎉 You're Ready!Choose one of the three deployment options above and your CSV Plot Studio will be live in minutes!**Recommended for first-time deployers**: Option 1 (Netlify CLI) or Option 2 (Drag & Drop)**Recommended for long-term**: Option 3 (Git integration) for automatic deployments---## 📞 Need Help?- Netlify Docs: https://docs.netlify.com- Netlify Support: https://answers.netlify.com- Next.js Static Export: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports---**Happy Deploying! 🚀**
